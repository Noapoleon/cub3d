to do:
	- BEFORE SUBMIT, AT THE END:
		* protect all defines settings
		* use ft_printf instead of printf where possible
		* check all inits
		* figure out what the weird visual bug is when going out of bounds
		* check if minimap is safe
	- handle collisions to walls
	- protect render distance
	- make a menu with 'esc' key
		* "continue" and "quit" options
		* maybe an "options" menu with toggles and sliders
	- add simple door, no texture
	- make door reopenable
	- add door texture
	- if shift key is pressed double player speed
	- add cursor

done:
	- init player rotation
	- player rotation
	- move player according to time elapsed
	- move player on map according to rotation
	- fix rotation at program start because mouse is not centered by default
	- fix rotation display
	- cast single ray from player rotation
	- make clean struct for casting single ray from player rot
	- w, a and d pressed is going right?
	- figure out why we're using prev_dist for casting???
	- fix fish eye effect
	- make mouse movement depend on delta time too
	- make keys rotate view (MANDATORY)
	- moved mlx_mouse_move inside of set_player_rotation because it was causing
	  lag

not doing:
	- reverse map coordinates XOR reverse player movement
		* reversing the map would be better for the long run but annoying for
		  displaying the map
	- allow quitting the game with q
		* nah, let's make an escape menu
	- make rotation amount a factor of the window's width (or not idk)
		* stupid, dont change rotation speed based on resolution
