to do:
	- BEFORE SUBMIT, AT THE END:
		* protect all defines settings
	- handle collisions to walls
	- protect render distance
	- make mouse movement depend on delta time too
	- make rotation amount a factor of the window's width (or not idk)

done:
	- init player rotation
	- player rotation
	- move player according to time elapsed
	- move player on map according to rotation
	- fix rotation at program start because mouse is not centered by default
	- fix rotation display
	- cast single ray from player rotation
	- make clean struct for casting single ray from player rot
	- w, a and d pressed is going right?
	- figure out why we're using prev_dist for casting???
	- fix fish eye effect

not doing:
	- reverse map coordinates XOR reverse player movement
		* reversing the map would be better for the long run but annoying for displaying the map
	- allow quitting the game with q
